an all around good general javaScript loading engine with room for your code.

two things to know.
adding -and- waiting

you add, and you wait. When it is loaded the wait is over, callback provided to write your script.

you can load in batches, 
you can load in arrays,
with ways to swap easily, generally for testing only

Why add this? . Well for one, testing. 
Think of your code as a bundle of papers
only these papers are script to transform things
there must be a way to organize this

Generally, people will name a new Variable.

But when that variable needs contact to another Variable, how do you know it's even loaded on the page?


Page started out from that. 


PAGE is a single variable for your whole app.

One variable you add to with your code. That way all your code can communicate together when they are loaded.

in your javascript console, you can type in the variable and see everything loaded.

PAGE
 \-YourCode
 \-Here
 \-there
       \-andHere
       

and you can easily test what is there with the testing module framework.
